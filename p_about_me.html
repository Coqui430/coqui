    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <img src="DSC03291-01.jpg" alt="Me">
    <p>Hey! I'm Rafael, I'm a beginning programmer that's trying to find his way in the Bay Area! 
        I'm from the East Coast of the US, was born in New York and was raised in New Jersey. I decided to come out to California
        because I always wanted to live here and had the oppertunity of a life time and I took it. I came out here
        in 2016 and been here since. I started out working at GameStop November of 2016, and started going to College of San Mateo
        Fall 2017. I first started studying Accounting but easily thought it wasn't for me. So I went with Computer Science
        and been with it since starting 2018. In 2018 I also started a new job at a startup company called Sandbox VR, and here I am today!
        I'm a pretty avid gamer as well, and listen to a bunch of music. Message me if you'd like to work together, game, or some music suggestions.
